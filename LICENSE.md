# Why don't I use licenses?

Well.. I have absolutely no idea which one to choose. So if you're confused. Here is what you can and can't do with my code, repositories and binaries. I didn't include basic "Run" or "Download" sections because that's a given. I wouldn't have uploaded them otherwise

<details>
<summary>✔️ Fork</summary>

# Fork
You have my full permission to fork my code. Granted, I request you to either leave my copyrights (if any) intact and add a little disclaimer. Even if it's just a little mention in a readme file.

Please use one of the following

```
By {YOUR USERNAME HERE}
[Original by Pikakid98 / https://pikakid98.github.io]
```

```
By {YOUR USERNAME HERE}
[Forked from Pikakid98's {MY PROGRAM} / {LINK TO PROGRAM}]
```

Another requirement is to state in the name of your fork that it IS a fork. Let's say I made a program called `VeryCoolNotepad`. Please call your fork something like `VeryCoolNotepad-{YOURUSERNAME}` or `VeryCoolNotePad-fork`

<summary>✔️ Record and stream</summary>

# Record and stream
If you choose to record or stream my games, programs etc. to your own viewers and wish to monetise the video/stream, I have absolutely no issues. Please be aware that some of my games may contain content that may get you into trouble if played on stream due to it not being mine. But for anything I own, go right ahead.. Get that bread XD

<details>
<summary> ✔️Contribute code</summary>

# Contribute code
I'm not the kind of person to get butthurt over someone coding better than me. So if you would like to help me with my code or fix some massive bugs, I would appreciate you dropping a GitHub issue or a pull request

</details>

<details>
<summary>➖ Redistribute</summary>

# Redistribute
Only in the event that all official sources go down. You MUST also provide the unaltered source code WITH copyrights.

Additionally. Unless explicitly stated, Assume that packaging my code with your games is forbidden. I **WILL** make exceptions to **SOME** programs and state it in it's own readme.

If you have included a tool of mine within a game or have forked an existing game of mine, you MUST link back to the original source if possible. If redistributing my program (if expressly allowed) please do not include any of my code within your project in the event that it's an entire program that you're using to prevent outdated or broken code from breaking your program. Please add a little note to your readme that the reader requires a tool and link to it. Plus, adding pre-compiled binaries to source code is always iffy.

An example:
```
# Building Requirements:
[Name of program](https://github.com/owner/repo)

```

The exception to this is redistributing it with the intent of adding malware to it. Whether via a shady installer or by forking it

<summary>❌ Sell</summary>

# Sell
I'm specifically talking about wholesale selling my tools as standalone products. This implies that the tool isn't being used within an existing commercial product and has just been outright ripped and/or my copyright removed and sold without my consent. This is STRICTLY forbidden. Whether you've put it on a storefront or are hiding it behind donations. If my code and ONLY my code is hidden behind ANY paywall, this is a violation of my license

However, The above line applies doubly to any games. You can NOT sell any of my games.. Even in pieces. Do NOT sell my games for money at ALL. The "sell" section only applies to TOOLS that have been specifically made to be sold with programs as libraries or little backend tools
